## Description

Are you interested in extreme training but unsure if your body is ready? If you answered yes, then Box Ready is for you!


Box Ready is an 8 week workout program split into 3 workouts a week intended to prepare your body for tough training. You will be exposed to various types of workouts you can expect from extreme training programs like crossfit, military boot camp, P90X, and many others. Box Ready also offers demonstration videos to teach you how to do the exercises properly, term explanations so you will know what people are talking about when you get to the gym, and a workout log to keep up with your progress.
